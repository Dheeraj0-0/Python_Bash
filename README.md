🚀 Python & Bash Learning Lab 🐍🐚

Learn → Practice → Break → Fix → Publish

Welcome to my personal learning playground 👋
This repository is where I practice Python and Bash scripting while learning, and publish everything openly.

No filters. No perfection. Just real progress.

📂 What’s Inside?

🧠 Python scripts
🖥️ Bash scripts
🧪 Small experiments & practice files
📈 Code that improves over time

Everything here is written while learning, not after mastering.

✨ Why This Repo Exists

🔁 To stay consistent with learning

📝 To document my journey publicly

💡 To help beginners who learn by example

🚀 To build the habit of shipping what I learn

🚧 Status: Always in Progress

This repo is alive 🫀

Rough logic

Refactors later on

That’s part of the journey.
